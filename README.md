## Starting the Game
Attach two controllers and run `python3 main.py`.

## Main Menu
Choose the game mode you want to play by pressing the up and down controls and pressing `select`. Note that for Two Player and Gun Game modes two controls must be attached. 

## Game Controls
- Move left and and right with the left and right controls
- Jump by pressing `B` button
- Pause game by presing `Start` button
- Gun Game specific controls:
  - Swap gun by pressing top left button
  - Shoot by pressing top right button

## Single Player and Two Player
Try to reach the end of the world without dying! Players can die from falling off the map and running into enemies like goombas.

## Gun Game
Fight to the death! Each player has access to a rocket launcher and an AK47. The rocket launcher deals much more damage, but also takes longer to reload and is slower, while the AK47 shoots and reloads faster but deals less damage. Player health is shown at the top!

## Known bugs
Sometimes players will glitch into walls or the floor. If that happens try to kill the player and select `replay`, and if that doesn't work press `M` on the keyboard to go to the main menu and restart.
